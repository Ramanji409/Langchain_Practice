LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
It provides components for building context-aware and reasoning-based applications.
You can use LangChain to create chatbots, question-answering systems, and other NLP tools.
LangChain supports models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and more.
It enables connection with vector databases like FAISS, Chroma, and Pinecone.
Vector databases store text embeddings and allow fast similarity searches.
Embeddings are numeric representations of text that capture its meaning.
LangChain can split large documents into smaller chunks for processing.
These chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database for retrieval.
When a user asks a question, LangChain finds the most relevant chunks.
This improves the response accuracy of large language models.
The CharacterTextSplitter is used to break text into fixed-size chunks
Chunk size and overlap help preserve context between splits.
FAISS is a popular open-source vector search library developed by Facebook.
It supports fast approximate nearest neighbor searches.
LangChain allows chaining multiple steps like retrieval, prompt templates, and LLM calls.
This chaining process enables advanced workflows like document QA or summarization.
LangChain can be used with Python and integrates well with external tools.
Developers use it to build scalable and intelligent AI apps.
Overall, LangChain bridges the gap between raw LLMs and real-world applications.
